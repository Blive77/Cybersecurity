#Tuning Volume Options
Adjusting volume options is a flexible process that can be done while the cluster is online and accessible.


It is advisable to enable the server.allow-insecure option to ON if your volume has numerous bricks or if there are multiple services already utilizing all the privileged ports in the system. Enabling this option allows ports to accept/reject messages from insecure ports. Only use this option if your deployment necessitates it.

To tune volume options, utilize the following command:
```bash
gluster volume set <VOLNAME>
```

For instance, to set the performance cache size for a volume named test-volume to 256MB:
```bash
gluster volume set test-volume performance.cache-size 256MB
```

The table below outlines various volume options, providing descriptions and default values:
