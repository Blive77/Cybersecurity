1. **Update System Packages:**
  - Ensure your system is up-to-date by running:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
     ```
2. **Additional Package Installation:**
   -You must install the following package:
     ```bash
     apt-get install apt-transport-https
     ```
3. **Import the GPG key:**
   -The packages are signed with a GPG key signature that you can find at the root of your download area:
    ```bash
    sudo cd /tmp &&
    wget https://www.bacula.org/downloads/Bacula-4096-Distribution-Verification-key.asc &&
    apt-key add Bacula-4096-Distribution-Verification-key.asc &&
    rm Bacula-4096-Distribution-Verification-key.asc &&
    ```
4. **apt Package Manager Configuration:**
   - Lets check, binay version in currently the version is 13.03:
    https://bacula.org/packages/5f1e8eefd1016/debs/
     - We installing in Ubuntu 22.04 jammy
     - Current version of bacula community
   
    - Add the following entries to a new file called:
    ```bash
    sudo /etc/apt/sources.list.d/Bacula-Community.list
    ```

    - Adapting the URL to point to your Download Area. Also, please pay careful attention
    to use the correct Bacula Community version and platform in the URL.
    ```
    # Bacula Community
    deb [arch=amd64] https://www.bacula.org/packages/@access-key@/debs/@bacula-version@ @ubuntu-version@ main
    ``` 
      Where:
      ◾ @access-key@ refers to your personalized area string. This is the trailing
      path component sent in the registration email. Copying the URI from that
      email will be one of the simplest ways to set this up correctly.
      ◾ @bacula-version@ should be replaced by the version of Bacula Community
      you are using (e. g. 13.0.1).
      ◾ @ubuntu-version@ is the code name of the distribution (“xenial” or “bionic”,
      for example).
    Complete example:
   
    ```
    #Bacula Community
    deb [arch=amd64] https://www.bacula.org/packages/5f1e8eefd1016/debs/13.0.1 jammy main
